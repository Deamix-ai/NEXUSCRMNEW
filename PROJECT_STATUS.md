## Current Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the web application (PRIMARY)
cd /Users/jonathonbarclay/Projects/CRM-Nexus/apps/web
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000-3003

# Start the full monorepo (has issues)
cd /Users/jonathonbarclay/Projects/CRM-Nexus
npm run dev
# May have workspace-related errors
```

### Data Storage
- **Development:** localStorage in browser (working)
- **Production:** PostgreSQL via Prisma (configured but not connected)

### Key Files to Understand

#### Core Context System
- `apps/web/src/contexts/CRMContext.tsx` - Main data management
- `apps/web/src/app/providers.tsx` - Provider configuration

#### Main Dashboard
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Functional dashboard with real data

#### Layout Components
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Main layout wrapper
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar

#### Other Pages (Need Context Integration)
- `apps/web/src/app/leads/page.tsx` - Leads management
- `apps/web/src/app/clients/page.tsx` - Client management
- `apps/web/src/app/jobs/page.tsx` - Job management

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Active Problems
1. **Monorepo Build Issues:** `npm run dev` from root has workspace errors
2. **API Server:** Not functional, multiple server file attempts
3. **React Native Types:** Type definition errors in shared packages
4. **Mobile Integration:** Mobile app not connected to web data layer

### Development Workarounds
- Run web app individually: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`
- Use localStorage instead of API for data persistence
- Manual file navigation instead of monorepo tooling

## Recent Progress (Session Summary)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Converted Static UI to Functional System:**
   - Moved from mock data to real React Context
   - Implemented working CRUD operations
   - Added localStorage persistence

2. **Fixed Technical Issues:**
   - Resolved TypeScript compilation errors
   - Fixed file import case sensitivity issues
   - Integrated CRMProvider across the application

3. **Dashboard Functionality:**
   - "New Lead" button actually creates leads
   - Statistics update in real-time
   - Recent leads list shows actual data
   - Professional status badge styling

4. **Data Architecture:**
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper enum definitions
   - Context provider pattern
   - Local storage synchronization

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads successfully
- ‚úÖ New Lead button adds data and updates stats
- ‚úÖ Recent leads list displays with proper styling

cd /Users/jonathonbarclay/Projects/CRM-Nexus

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start web application only (RECOMMENDED)
cd apps/web
npm run dev

# Access application

## Project Context for AI Assistant

### What This System Does
This is a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system specifically designed for a bathroom installation business. It manages:
- **Leads:** Potential customers interested in bathroom renovations
- **Clients:** Existing customers with confirmed projects
- **Jobs:** Active bathroom installation/renovation projects
- **Scheduling:** Appointment and project timeline management

### Current Status Summary
- **UI:** Professional, complete, responsive design ‚úÖ
- **Functionality:** Basic CRUD operations working with localStorage ‚úÖ
- **Data Layer:** React Context with TypeScript interfaces ‚úÖ
- **Backend:** Minimal, needs implementation ‚ùå
- **Mobile:** Complete UI, needs data integration üü°
- **Authentication:** Configured but not active ‚ùå

### Key Achievement
**The CRM has transitioned from a static UI shell to a functional application** where users can actually add leads, see real-time statistics, and have data persist between sessions. This represents the foundation for a fully working CRM system.

### Development Philosophy
- **Pragmatic Approach:** Build working features incrementally
- **TypeScript First:** Strict typing throughout the codebase
- **Component Reusability:** Shared UI components across web and mobile
- **Modern Stack:** Latest versions of React, Next.js, and supporting libraries

This documentation should provide complete context for continuing development on the CRM-Nexus project.
